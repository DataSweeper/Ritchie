Functions and Program Structure:
--------------------------------

	Basics of functions --> BasicsOfFunction.md
	Functions Returning Non-integers --> FunctionRNonInteger.md	
	External Variables --> ExternalVaribles.md
	Scope Rules --> ScopeRules.md
	Header Files  --> HeaderFiles.md
	Static Variables --> StaticVariable.md
	Register Variables --> RegisterVariable.md
	Block Structure --> BlockStructure.md
	Initialization --> Initialization.md
	Recursion --> Recursion.md
	The C preprocessor - Cpreprocessor.md


Functions break large computing task into smaller ones, and enable people to build on what
others have done instead starting over from scratch. Appropriate function hide details of
operations from parts of the program that dont need to know about them, thus clarifying the
whole, and easing the pain of making changes.
